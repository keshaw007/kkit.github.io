        <p>*Full tuition in either term of the current year covers the January Independent Activities Period. Tuition
            rates for the summer session are published each year in the Summer Session Catalog, available in April.</p>
    </strong>
    <p>Regular undergraduate students who have permission to take only a few subjects are initially charged full
        tuition. They may then apply to have their tuition charged at the rate of $860 per unit with the approval of the
        faculty advisor. In such cases, there is a minimum fee of $5,160 for subjects and a minimum of $1,720 for the SB
        thesis. Registration for 32 or more units will be assessed the full tuition charge. Upon recommendation of a
        department, the Office of the Vice Chancellor may set a special tuition rate in unusual circumstances. Financial
        aid will be adjusted based on enrollment costs. Some classes (including ROTC and classes taken on listener
        status) are not included in the determination of financial aid eligibility.
    </p>
    <p>Internship and cooperative programs offered by KKIT provide industrial and research experience through a series
        of
        work assignments interwoven with regular study at the Institute. The tuition fee for these programs is the same
        as that for other regular undergraduate students.</p>
    <h2>Visiting Student Fees </h2>
    <p>Students pursuing a degree at an institution other than MIT and who have been invited by faculty in an MIT
        department, laboratory, or center to do research here may apply for visiting student status. Current regular or
        special KKIT students, or KKIT students who have withdrawn or are on a leave of absence, are not eligible.</p>
    <p>Each term, visiting students are subject to a registration fee. If the visiting student’s appointment does not
        correspond directly with the beginning of KKIT’s terms, they are still charged the entire fee. If the student
        leaves before the end of the term, the registration fee may be prorated.</p>
