    <h1>OUR STUDENT's CLUBS</h1>
    <p>KKIT students organize more than 450 official student groups, or about 1 for every 10 undergraduates. If you
        don’t
        find an existing club or organization to match your interests, it’s easy to start your own, and get together
        with your friends to nerd out however your heart desires</p>
    <p>Ask anyone at KKIT what their favorite thing is about the Institute and they’ll probably say “the people.” The
        quality of the KKIT community is the single biggest reason why admitted students enroll, and why Professor
        Emeritus Jay Keyser once observed that “KKIT is hard to get into, and even harder to leave.”</p>

            where we now boast about several National level swimmers; one of those activities that dispels the running
            myth that KKIT students just study,study and .......! The Swimming club started functioning in 1983. Since
            then, every year, one or more swimmers, have regularly been selected by Maharashtra, to represent the State
            at the Nationals. Several campus youngsters have got motivated to join, and have excelled at the
            sub-junior/junior level. The KKIT Swimming club regularly holds NSO swimming activities for students.
            Advanced swimming camps are held year round for swimmers showing promise. The KKIT Aquatic team has made a
            habit of returning with the GOLD from almost all Inter KKIT Aquatic meets held so far. Every year, triathlon
            competetions are held for KKIT students and campus children. A 12-hour SWIMMATHON, is an annual event
            eagerly
            awaited and gleefully entered by KKIT students and campus children. The high point of the year is the Annual
            swimming Gala, a State level swimming meet, normally held in February. Considered a very prestigious
            swimming event in Swimming circles, it attracts the best from all over the state</p>

            life and to keep people in touch with Nature. Places like Rajmachi, Kabubai, Bhimashankar and
            Harishchandragad were visited last semester. Last summer, ten club members earned a Basic Mountaineering
