    <h2>OUR SELECTION PROCESS</h2>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>After you click the submit button, it’s easy to feel like your application has entered a black hole. So what
        really happens between when you apply and when you receive your decision?<br>

        Once your application is complete, it will first be read by a senior admissions officer who will consider your
        application in a holistic manner, within its proper context. Strong applications will then be evaluated by
        additional admissions officers, who will summarize it for the Admissions <br>

        These summaries, along with your entire application, will then go to the selection committee, where multiple
        groups of different admissions staff and faculty members will weigh in. At least a dozen people will
        significantly discuss and debate an application before it is placed in the admit pile. <br></p>
    <h3>Student-centered</h3>
    <p>This is all very intentional. The committee process ensures that every decision is correct in the context of the
        overall applicant pool, and that no one individual’s biases, preferences, or familiarity with a given case has
        any chance of swaying a decision <br>

        Our process is a student-centered process, not a school- or region-centered process. This means that we do not
        read your application along with other students from your school or region to compare you against each other;
        each applicant stands on their own. We have no quotas by school, state, or region. You are not at any
        disadvantage if other excellent students from your school or area are also applying. We also do not consider
        legacy/alumni relations in our process <br></p>
